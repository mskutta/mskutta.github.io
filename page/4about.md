I am an Architect at One North and a Sitecore MVP with more than 18 years of experience architecting, designing and developing software, as well as leading technology teams. I currently serve as an Architect within the Technology Labs group, which works to research, test and integrate new technologies for both One North and its clients. Most recently, I architected and developed reusable frameworks and processes for custom legal Sitecore implementations. This includes object-relational mappers, service bus data integrations, custom field types, custom workflows, custom pipelines, automated builds, and automated deployments. Prior to One North, I served as an Architect for Hubbard One, where I designed and developed web content management systems and business development applications for law firms. Previously, I worked as a Manager and Consultant at Accenture. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
