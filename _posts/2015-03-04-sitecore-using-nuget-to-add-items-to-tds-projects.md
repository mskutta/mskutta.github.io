excerpt: At One North, we wanted to improve development efficiencies by providing a starting point for our Sitecore projects. Based on the domain or industry we were doing a Sitecore implementation for, we could provide an initial data model to start with. This would not only decrease the time to setup the initial data model, but it would allow us to carry forward what we have learned on a domain before.
