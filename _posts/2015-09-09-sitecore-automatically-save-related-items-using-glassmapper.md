excerpt: Sitecore items support relationships, be that parent, child or linked, to other items. Glass.Mapper easily works with these types of relationships. It not only supports them when retrieving items, but also while saving. Glass.Mapper even checks to make sure all related items exist before saving the item, essentially enforcing referential integrity.
