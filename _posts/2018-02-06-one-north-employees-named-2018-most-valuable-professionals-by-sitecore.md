**CHICAGO, IL (February 6, 2018)** - One North, a digital agency for professional services organizations, announced Ethel Crosby, Director of Technology Operations &amp; Offerings, and Mike Skutta, Architect, have been named &ldquo;Most Valuable Professionals (MVP)&rdquo; by Sitecore, a global leader in experience management software. Crosby was recognized with the new Ambassador award, while Skutta received his Technology MVP title for the third year in a row.

One North, a Sitecore Platinum Implementation Partner, also recently released its [Sitecore for PSO offering](https://content.onenorth.com/sitecoreforpso), a custom experience designed for professional services organizations to get the most out of their Sitecore investment.

"Both Crosby and Skutta were significant contributors to the creation of our Sitecore for PSO offering," said John Simpson, CEO at One North. "The Sitecore MVP honor demonstrates that One North has both a depth of technology understanding and the marketing acumen to help our clients get the most business value out of Sitecore's robust features.

In addition to guiding the creation of Sitecore for PSO, Crosby is responsible for the management and execution of leading digital technology solutions and product management, continuously identifying new strategic technology opportunities for One North and its clients.

Skutta's leadership has helped solidify the agency's position as a key player in the Sitecore community by developing and sharing new technology insights with the online community. He also serves as a mentor to One North's Sitecore developers, educating and ensuring implementations are of the highest quality.

"Sitecore has an extensive ecosystem of professionals and experts who serve as a driving force behind thousands of successful Sitecore implementations taking place across the globe," said Pieter Brinkman, Sitecore Senior Director of Technical Marketing. "Our MVPs are vital members of this ecosystem, and the Sitecore MVP Awards honor their substantial contribution to the community. Furthermore, Sitecore MVPs continue to raise the bar, as their willingness to share expertise and commitment to giving back to the Sitecore community is unmatched."

MVP candidates are evaluated by a panel of Sitecore employees ranging from developers to members of the executive team. They are selected based on their mastery of Sitecore&rsquo;s platform and ability to share knowledge with Sitecore partners, customers and prospects.
