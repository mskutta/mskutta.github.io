A [vCard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) is essentially an electronic business card. Like a standard business card, vCards contain business related information about an individual or company. Usually this includes contact information such as the company name, the personâ€™s name, address, phone numbers, email addresses and social media links. vCards can be attached to e-mail messages, shared through instant messaging, downloaded from web pages and distributed through various other forms of media.
