excerpt: I was tasked to create a sales demo from an existing Sitecore training site. The existing training site was completely functional and had a good amount of data. There were a couple items that I needed to address to convert the training site into a sales demo. First, I needed to update the look and feel of it so it wouldnâ€™t resemble the training site. Secondly, and most importantly, I needed to scramble the data so it was unrecognizable.
