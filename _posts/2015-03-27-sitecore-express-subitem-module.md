excerpt: We had a need to support relationships in Sitecore that also contained metadata or supplemental information about a relationship or multiple relationships. Examples of these types of relationships are... 1. The organizations a person belongs to and the roles they play within the organization. 2. The offices an employee belongs to including their contact information for that office. 3. A personâ€™s education with the School, Degree, Description, and year obtained. This information is specific to the item (parent) that owns it. No other item has the same information. In these particular cases the information is part of the parent item. The information only exists if the parent exists. If the parent is deleted, this information is also deleted.
