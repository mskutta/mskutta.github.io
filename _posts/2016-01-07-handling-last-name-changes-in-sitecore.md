excerpt: I wanted to share with you an approach for handling Last Name changes for items that represent people in Sitecore. The problem you usually face when changing a person’s name is what to do with their record after you’ve changed the name. An example of this is a maiden name change from Jane Smith to Jane Doe. Typically, the item name represents the name of the person. Jane Smith could have an item name of “Smith Jane.” The item names are used as part of the URL. To get to Jane Smith’s information on the public site, the URL may look like http://www.site.com/people/s/smith_jane.
