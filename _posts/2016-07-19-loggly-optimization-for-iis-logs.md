For two years now, we have been using [Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/docs/about-loggly/) at One North, and it has proven to be a valuable DevOps tool for our organization.  This service allows us to view and search our logs quickly across environments and applications such as [Sitecore](http://www.sitecore.net/partners/find-partner/o/one-north-interactive.aspx) and other web CMS applications.
