excerpt: Contact us forms are common on the sites I work on. Many times, the end result of a user filling out a contact us form is sending a confirmation e-mail to that user. The confirmation e-mail generally includes information that the user filled out on the contact us form. This information is intermixed with other text content, such as labels and other messaging. Content managers may have a need to modify the text and layout within the confirmation e-mails on an ongoing basis.
