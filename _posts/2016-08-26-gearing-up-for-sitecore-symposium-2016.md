excerpt: In a few weeks, we’ll be heading down to New Orleans for the 2016 Sitecore Symposium. As a Sitecore Platinum Implementation Partner, we’re excited to sponsor and attend the Symposium’s first “global conference experience,” giving us the opportunity to network with and learn from Sitecore experts from around the world. This year, personalization and context are key themes we’re looking forward to exploring more.
