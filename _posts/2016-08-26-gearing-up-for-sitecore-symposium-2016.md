In a few weeks, we'll be heading down to New Orleans for the [2016 Sitecore Symposium](http://www.sitecore.net/events/sitecore-symposium-2016/introduction.aspx). As a Sitecore Platinum Implementation Partner, we're excited to sponsor and attend the Symposium's first "global conference experience," giving us the opportunity to network with and learn from Sitecore experts from around the world. This year, personalization and context are key themes we're looking forward to exploring more.

Going to be in New Orleans for the Symposium as well? Catch up with us at **booth #216**. We'd also love for you to join us for some authentic N'Awlins food, drinks and fun at [The Rusty Nail](http://www.therustynail.biz/) on Wednesday night, 9/14 from 8-11pm. Come enjoy the patio ambiance, sip free drinks and share delicious, New Orleans-style hors d'oeuvres with our team. [RSVP here](http://content.onenorth.com/afterhoursmixer), or simply bring your printed invite from our booth to the party.

We'll see you all in New Orleans! And for those of you who won't be able to make it, don't worry; we'll be posting highlights from the event so you don't miss out.
