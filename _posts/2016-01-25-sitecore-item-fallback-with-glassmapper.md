excerpt: If youâ€™re building sites with a global presence and multiple languages/regions, you may need some kind of language fallback functionality. Language fallback is the process of determining what language to serve when the content has not been translated in the requested language. In Sitecore, language fallback can occur at the item level and the field level. At the item level, if there is no version in the requested language, a fallback language version can be served instead. At the field level, if a field does not have content for the requested language, content for that field can be pulled from the fallback language version of the item.
