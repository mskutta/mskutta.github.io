excerpt: Sitecore 7 introduced many improvements to Lucene Search. Among those improvements was the added LINQ support for Lucene queries. Developers can now use LINQ-based queries to retrieve data from the Lucene indexes. Prior to Sitecore 7, developers generally had 2 ways to build the query. The first way was to build up a query using the Field Query Object Model. This provided an object model to create complex queries. A second way was to form a string-based representation of a query using the Lucene Query Parser to interpret the string.
