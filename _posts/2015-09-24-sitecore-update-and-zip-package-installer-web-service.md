excerpt: I am in the process of automating Sitecore deployments using Octopus Deploy.  As part of this process, I need to install .update packages that are generated by TDS and also .zip packages generated by developers.  Out of the box, Sitecore provides a way to manually upload these packages through the backend GUI.  They also provide an API to upload the packages. Octopus Deploy has the ability to run PowerShell scripts as part of its deployment process.  I need a way to install the packages through a PowerShell script.  One way to achieve this is to create a custom web service that uses the Sitecore API to install the packages.  The PowerShell script can then call the web service.  Using a blocking web service, Octopus Deploy will wait until the installation of the packages completes.
