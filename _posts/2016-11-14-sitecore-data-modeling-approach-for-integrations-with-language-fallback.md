excerpt: We have several clients that integrate or sync data from their HR system into Sitecore.  This typically consists of “people data.”  These people appear on the website with their respective biographies. The data is brought over to Sitecore on a recurring basis.  While the HR system is considered the authoritative source for the people data, sometimes the marketing department requires the ability to override the data in Sitecore.  In some cases, the data from the HR system is not the data they want to display on the website. How do you support this within Sitecore?  There are various ways to setup the data templates and structure the data.  One way we have found that works well and does not require any additional logic is using language fallback.
