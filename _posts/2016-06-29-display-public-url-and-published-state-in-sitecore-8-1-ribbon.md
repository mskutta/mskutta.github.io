excerpt: We ran across a helpful blog post by Kevin Buckley explaining how to display the published state of an item in the Sitecore ribbon using a ribbon panel. This ribbon panel displays the version published by language if the item has been published. If the items is not published, it indicates that. We implemented this and have found it to be very useful for our content administrators.
