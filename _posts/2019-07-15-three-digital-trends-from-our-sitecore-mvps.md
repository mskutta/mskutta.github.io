excerpt: Last month, Sitecore officially opened registration for the 2019 Sitecore Symposium, Human Connections in a Digital World. Our team cannot wait until November! The Symposium has always proved to be an excellent forum for connecting with the Sitecore community of developers, partners and clients, as well as educating ourselves on what’s to come, both within the platform and in the overall marketplace.  As we anxiously await our trip to Orlando, we sat down with our Sitecore MVPs – Ethel Crosby, director of technology operations and offerings; Mike Skutta, architect; and Amitabh Vyas, technical architect – to discuss recent trends and challenges in the digital space; cybersecurity, headless architecture and personalization. Our MVPs also revealed an “insider view” of Sitecore’s latest offerings and how to best take advantage of the platform.
