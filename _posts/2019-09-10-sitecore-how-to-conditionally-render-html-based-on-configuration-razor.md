## Overview

This is an article in a series of Sitecore how-to articles. These articles are meant to be quick guides to accomplish various tasks within Sitecore. The how-to articles have proven to be very helpful internally at *One North Interactive* https://www.onenorth.com.  These articles assume working Sitecore knowledge. I just wanted to share the articles with the community. Hopefully you find them helpful.

## How-To

This article explains how to change your output markup of your Sitecore site according to its configuration.

Sometimes, you may want to render something differently in development versus production.

A good example of this is scripts loaded via CDN. [Vue, for example](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/deployment.html#Turn-on-Production-Mode):

> **Turn on Production Mode**
>
> During development, Vue provides a lot of warnings to help you with common errors and pitfalls. However, these warning strings become useless in production and bloat your appâ€™s payload size. In addition, some of these warning checks have small runtime costs that can be avoided in production mode.

## Step-by-step guide

To do this, we can define and use an HtmlHelper extension method which checks the Sitecore configuration for a feature-specific (in this case, HTML rendering) value.

**z.OneNorth.Html.config**
```xml
<configuration xmlns:patch="http://www.sitecore.net/xmlconfig/">
  <sitecore>
    <settings>
      <setting name="OneNorth.HtmlEnvironment" value="dev"/>
    </settings>
  </sitecore>
</configuration>
```

**HtmlHelperExtensions.cs**
```csharp
using System.Web.Mvc;
 
public static class HtmlHelperExtensions
{
    public static bool IsDebug(this HtmlHelper htmlHelper)
    {
        return Sitecore.Configuration.Settings.GetSetting("OneNorth.HtmlEnvironment") == "dev";
    }
}
```

**DefaultLayout.cshtml**
```cshtml
@if (Html.IsDebug())
{
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue"></script>
} else
{
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.6.10/dist/vue.js"></script>
}
```
