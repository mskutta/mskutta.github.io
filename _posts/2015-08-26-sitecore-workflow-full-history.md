excerpt: Our clients were asking for a way to view Workflow History for all versions of an item at the same time. Out of the box, Sitecore provides a way to view the Workflow History for the current version of an item. We decided to create an additional “Full History” button in the Workflow group that allowed our clients to view the full history. The Full History button only appears for items that are participating in workflow.
